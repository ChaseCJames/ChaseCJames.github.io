### Why I became a scientist
(and how I got to where I am today)

Growing up near the Puget Sound in Seattle, Washington I always felt a magnetic pull towards the ocean. Each year, my mom and I would look up the tide charts and circle those days on the calendar where the tides were going to be **super** low. I always knew on those days I'd see something truly awesome. From giant sunflower sea stars (*Pycnopodia helianthoides*) to giant green sea anenomes (*Anthopleura xanthogrammica*) these "giants" of the Pacific Northwest were even larger in my childhood imagination. 

My favorite book as a young child was Davy's Dream by Paul Owens Lewis. The boy in the book dreams of one day sailing with orcas---a dream that quickly became my own. And while I did finally manage to go see orcas up in the San Juan Islands, as I grew up, my dream morphed into an intense desire to study and understand the natural world. 

This led me to get a B.S. in Biology at the University of California, San Diego, quickly followed by a M.S. in Biology. During my masters I studied both honey bee and stingless bee behavior and was fortunate enough to spend six months in Tapachula, Mexico. After countless bee stings, I eventually transitioned into a PhD program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. And while my journey has taken the ocassional unforseen turn, I always feel lucky that I ended up in a field that allows my childhood daydreams come to life.

### When I am not science-ing...

My love of the natural world extends beyond my working life.

During my PhD surfing was a great way to take a mental break and get the heart racing before a day of work. It's fair to say I was a bit spoiled at SIO (there aren't many places where you can have a surfboard rack in your office). While the surf is a bit further away from where I live in LA, I always trying to squeeze in a weekly session when the waves are good!

In the last few years, climbing has become my primary sport and hobby. There is something exhilarating about the combined mental and physical strength required to climb well. When I am not thinking about work my mind often is centered on climbing. It is sport that requires laser-like focus and as such, punishes the distracted climber. In this way, climbing has become my mediation zone and nothing helps unblock my scientific or writing mind like a hard day of climbing.

And finally, my hobby for when I have truly and finally run out of hours in the day to spend outdoors...swing dancing. Growing up as a kid who played every sport I could sign up for, I never would have imagined that swing dancing would become such an important component of my life. From driving up 2-3 times a week during my master's program to compete with a team in Orange County, to teaching every few months at the Firehouse Swing Dance in San Diego, swing dancing is a passion I will carry with me for the rest of my life. There are few things in life that can match the utter joy of dancing with a complete stranger and instantly connecting to the music and each other.
