### Why I became a scientist (and how I got to where I am today)

Growing up near the Puget Sound in Seattle, Washington I always felt a magnetic pull towards the ocean. Each year, my mom and I would look up the tide charts and circle those days on the calendar where the tides were going to be **super** low. I always knew on those days I'd see something truly awesome. From giant sunflower sea stars (*Pycnopodia helianthoides*) to giant green sea anenomes (*Anthopleura xanthogrammica*) these "giants" of the Pacific Northwest were even larger in my childhood imagination. My favorite book as a young child was Davy's Dream by Paul Owens Lewis. The boy in the book dreams of one day sailing with orcas---a dream that quickly became my own. And while I did finally manage to go see orcas up in the San Juan Islands, as I grew up, my dream morphed into an intense desire to study and understand the natural world. This led me to get a B.S. in Biology at the University of California, San Diego, quickly followed by a M.S. in Biology. During my masters I studied both honey bee and stingless bee behavior and was fortunate enough to spend six months in Tapachula, Mexico. After countless bee stings and one or two Modelos after a long day of field work, I eventually transitioned into a PhD program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. And while my journey has taken the ocassional unforseen turn, I always feel lucky that I ended up at a place that feels like my childhood daydreams come to life.
