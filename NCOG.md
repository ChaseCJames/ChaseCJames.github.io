Within the Southern California Current, biogeographical patterns have been documented from fish communities to eukaryotic plankton communities. The NOAA CalCOFI Genomics Project ([NCOG](https://calcofi.org/field-work/bottle-sampling/ncog-project/525-noaa-calcofi-genomics-project.html)) provides a new opportunity to assess the biogeographical patterns of major marine microbial groups within the region and identify the physical gradients that drive microbial community patterns.
