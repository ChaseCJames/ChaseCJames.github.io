Within the Southern California Current, biogeographical patterns have been documented from fish communities to eukaryotic plankton communities. The NOAA CalCOFI Ocean Genomics Project ([NCOG](https://calcofi.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=234&Itemid=1142)) provides a new opportunity to assess the biogeographical patterns of major marine microbial groups within the region and identify the environmental processes that drive microbial community structure and diversity.
