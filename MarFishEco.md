At [MarFishEco](https://marfisheco.com/) I work as a data analyst and visualization lead, specializing in the design and development of clear and accessible data visualizations. As a systems ecologist, I feel most at home when data wrangling disparate datasets in order to illuminate linkages, uncovering patterns that ultimately tell stories pertinent to the needs of our clients. I often spends my time exploring spatio-temporal trends in data through varied approaches including machine learning, time series analysis, and statistics.

My consultancy experience has included reports on salmon returns in Alaska, business analytics for M&A and investment projects and socio-economic performance evaluations of some of the worldâ€™s largest fleets.
